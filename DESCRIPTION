Description: Simple exploratory text mining and document clustering of journal
    articles from JSTOR's Data for Research service. Go to
    http://dfr.jstor.org/, make a request for data (specify CSV as outout
    format and Word Counts as data type), then once you get a zip file, unzip
    it and start with one of the unpack functions and then you're ready to go
    with any of the other functions. For more details on installation and
    usage, see https://github.com/UW-ARCHY-textual-macroanalysis-lab/JSTORr
